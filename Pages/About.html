                <p>From my earliest days, I've been captivated by computer science. Learning HTML at age 12 ignited my programming curiosity, and I hold a Java Associate SE7 Programmer certification from Oracle, further solidifying my expertise in software development. I've gained practical experience, contributing to commercial software development projects using C# for a year. This experience taught me the value of teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability.</p>
                <p>In addition to my professional experience, I have a strong foundation in 3D graphics and game development. At age 21, I took the initiative to self-teach 3D graphics using Cinema 4D and Blender, enhancing my creativity and skills. I have also explored game development as a hobby, learning Unity and Unreal Engine 5. This has honed my creativity and critical thinking skills.</p>
