                <p>My name is Przemek (pronounced Shemec), and I'm deeply passionate about software development, computer graphics, and technology. I started my journey at age 12 by teaching myself HTML, which ignited my curiosity for programming. My tech path faced a pause for a few years, but my passion never waned, waiting for the right moment.</p>
                <p>At 21, I self-taught 3D graphics using Cinema 4D, fostering a creative eye for design and aesthetics that now influence my software development projects. I blend technical skills with design sensibility to create user-friendly and visually appealing software.</p>
                <p>Expanding my knowledge, I pursued formal Java courses at age 29, deepening my understanding of software engineering principles and best practices. This led to my first software developer position, where I gained hands-on experience and diversified my skill set with C#.</p>
                <p>Currently, I'm pursuing a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing with a focus on software and web development. The program provides a comprehensive understanding of current tech trends, including web application development, database management, and software architecture. My coursework reintroduces me to various programming languages and tools like Java, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I'm continuously broadening my horizons by learning Unreal Engine 5 and actively creating a First-Person Perspective project. This reflects my commitment to exploring new technologies and honing my game development and interactive experience skills.</p>
